#1. Motivation and Overview:
#The project aims to develop an authentication app using the Shiny framework in R. The motivation behind this project is to create a secure and user-friendly platform for user authentication, with additional features such as user profile management, connection tracking, messaging, job board, and more.

#2. Related Work:
#The development of this authentication app was inspired by various resources, including Shiny documentation, online tutorials, and best practices in web development and security protocols. Additionally, concepts from courses on web application development and data security have influenced the design and implementation of this project.

#3.Initial Questions:
#Initially, the primary question was how to create a secure authentication system using Shiny in R. As the project progressed, additional questions arose, such as how to implement user profile management, connection tracking, and messaging functionalities while ensuring data privacy and security.

#4. Data:
#The dataset used in this project consists of user credentials stored in-memory as a dataframe. The data includes usernames and hashed passwords for authentication purposes. Data import and manipulation are done directly within the Shiny application.

#5. Exploratory Data Analysis:
#As the project primarily focuses on application development rather than traditional data analysis, the exploratory data analysis phase mainly involves examining the structure and content of the user data dataframe. Visualization techniques are not extensively utilized in this context.

#6. Data Analysis:
#The statistical and computational methods employed in this project revolve around user authentication, validation, and management processes. Techniques such as password hashing, username validation, and user registration are central to the functionality of the authentication app.

#code defines the user interface (UI) for an authentication app using Shiny, a web application framework for R. Here's a breakdown of the code:

#NavbarPage: This creates a navigation bar with multiple tabs. The title of the navbar is set to "Authentication App". The id parameter assigns an identifier to the navbar, and the selected parameter specifies the initial tab to be displayed when the app loads.

#Tab Panels:

#"Login" Tab: Displays a login form created using login_ui.
#"Sign Up" Tab: Displays a sign-up form created using signup_ui.
#"My Profile" Tab: Contains a form for users to fill in their basic resume information such as name, email, phone number, education, experience, and skills. It also includes a button to submit the form.
#"My Connections" Tab: Displays information about the user's connections, including friends, mentors, and employers. It also includes a plot showing the user's role.
#"My Messages" Tab: Shows messages from employers and mentors.
#"Search Page" Tab: Allows users to search for companies or profiles.
#"Job Board" Tab: Allows users to apply for a job by providing job title, company, resume, name, email, skills, experience, and a cover letter.
#"About Us" Tab: Displays information about the platform, including a disclaimer.
#"Mentor Support" Tab: Provides a form for users to request mentor support by entering the mentor's name and email.
#Fluid Pages: Each tab panel contains a fluid page, which adapts to different screen sizes.

#UI Components:

#Headings and Subheadings: Used to organize and label different sections.
#Input Fields: Text input fields (textInput) are used for users to enter various information such as name, email, etc. Password input fields (passwordInput) are used for entering passwords. File input (fileInput) is used for uploading resumes.
#Action Buttons: actionButton is used to trigger actions such as form submission.
#Text Outputs: verbatimTextOutput is used to display text output.
#Plots: plotOutput is used to display plots.
#HTML Content: tags$div is used to embed HTML content, particularly for displaying the disclaimer in the "About Us" tab.
#Overall, this code defines a comprehensive UI for an authentication app, allowing users to login, sign up, manage their profile, view connections and messages, search for information, apply for jobs, and access platform information.

#Connections Data:

#Dummy data is generated for friends, mentors, and employers.
#Each connection is represented as a text output (output$friend1, output$mentor2, etc.) containing the name of the connection along with their role.
#Messages:

#Dummy messages are generated from employers and mentors.
#Messages include both positive and informational content, such as shortlisting notifications, requests for additional details, congratulations, feedback on resumes, and invitations for meetings.
#Messages are represented as text outputs (output$employer_msg1, output$mentor_msg2, etc.) with specific content for each message.
#Overall, this code simulates the presence of connections and messages within the application, providing users with a sense of interaction and engagement with other users, employers, and mentors

#This code snippet defines the server logic for generating search results dynamically based on user input in a Shiny web application. It initializes a set of dummy search results, filters them based on the user's search query using case-insensitive pattern matching, and renders the filtered results in the UI. If no results are found, it displays a message indicating that no results were found.

#This code defines the server logic for generating a user role distribution plot in a Shiny web application. It creates a plot illustrating the growth of users over time, utilizing dummy data for the number of users over a range of years. The plot function generates a line plot with years on the x-axis and user counts on the y-axis, with additional specifications for axis labels, plot title, line color, and line width. The resulting plot is rendered in the Shiny UI using renderPlot.
#demonstarting user applicants in different countries.

```{r}
shinyApp(ui = tagList(ui, tags$style(css)), server = server)
```
#The shinyApp function is used to create a Shiny application, which consists of both user interface (UI) elements and server-side logic. In this code, ui represents the UI definition, tags$style(css) adds custom CSS styling to the UI, and server represents the server-side logic. These components are combined using tagList(ui, tags$style(css)) to ensure that the UI elements are styled according to the specified CSS rules. Finally, the server = server argument pairs the defined server logic with the UI, completing the setup of the Shiny application. When the shinyApp function is executed with these arguments, it launches the Shiny application with the specified UI and server logic.

#Narrative and Summary:
#Narrative:
#The provided code constitutes a Shiny web application designed for user authentication and networking functionalities. It is structured to  enable users to log in, sign up, manage their profiles, connect with friends, mentors, and employers, exchange messages, search for companies or profiles, and apply for jobs. Despite its illustrative nature with dummy data, the application showcases a range of interactive UI elements and server-side logic to facilitate user interactions.

#Summary:

#The application revolves around user authentication and networking features.It encompasses functionalities for login, signup, profile management, connections, messaging, job search, and an "About Us" section.Dummy data is generated for connections, messages, search results, user role distribution plot, and user location map.The code employs reactive elements for dynamic UI updates based on user interactions.While functional for demonstration purposes, the application lacks real-world data integration, security measures, and scalability considerations
